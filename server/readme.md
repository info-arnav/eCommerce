# Server Side - E-commerce Backend

This folder contains the backend APIs, including the logic for handling payment gateways, database connections, user authentication, and security features for the e-commerce application.

## Getting Started

To start the server locally in development mode:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

By default, the server will run on port 1234. You can access it through http://localhost:1234.

## Production Mode

To run the server in production mode:

1. Start the server in production mode:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

The production server will be optimized and will handle live traffic, including the payment gateway integrations and database connections securely.
