# E-commerce Base Application

This is a high-security base for creating any e-commerce application. It includes essential features such as an integrated payment gateway, a secure backend, SEO optimization, and a fully connected database.

The project is split into two primary sections:

1. **Client Side** - Built with **Next.js**, this is the frontend of the e-commerce application.
2. **Server Side** - The backend of the application, providing essential APIs, security features, and payment integration.

## Folder Structure

- /root
  - /client # Client-side Next.js application
  - /server # Server-side backend (API, payment gateway, database)

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the respective folders (`client` or `server`) to set up the client or server side of the application.
